<p>
The affinity diagram shows what we as a group care about the most when resolving the issue of washers and dryers being left full of laundry. Each category has its respective sticky notes (color-coded) listed beneath. The cause category relates to the causes of people abandoning their clothes, which we determined was mostly because of the app being incorrect at times. 
  Solutions for this can be found in the category titled "Accuracy of Detecting an Open Machine." The other categories include our solutions and other issues. In our solution, 
  we felt a passion for ensuring the security of each person's clothes, as they can be valuable.

This storyboard tells that of an average college student who wants to do laundry.

She is happy that these upgrades work and has decided to keep using the new app. This not only makes her life easier but gives the laundry company a good name.
